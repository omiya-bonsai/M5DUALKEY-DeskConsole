M5DUALKEY-DeskConsole is a compact USB HID controller for macOS, built from M5Stack Chain DualKey, Encoder, and Angle modules.

It sends standard keyboard, consumer-control, and mouse-wheel events. Audio-output switching is delegated to Raycast (or another macOS automation tool), keeping operating-system-specific work outside the firmware.

## Features

- One-touch audio-output selection and toggle shortcuts
- Hardware volume and mute control
- Spring-centered auto-scroll with startup calibration and hysteresis
- Low-brightness RGB status indicators for audio output and mute
- Automatic discovery of Chain Encoder and Angle modules

## Hardware

The orientation with the USB-C port on the rear side is treated as the front in this project. All left/right references use this viewing direction. From left to right, the official physical layout is DualKey, Encoder, then Angle.

- M5Stack Chain DualKey
- M5Stack Chain Encoder
- M5Stack Chain Angle
- USB connection to macOS

## Quick Controls

| Module | Control | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DualKey | Left | Select ORA4 (`Ctrl + Cmd + 1`), red LED |
| DualKey | Right | Select Studio Display (`Ctrl + Cmd + 2`), yellow LED |
| DualKey | Both | Toggle output (`Ctrl + Option + S`) |
| Encoder | Turn / press | Volume Up, Volume Down, or Mute; purple LED while muted |
| Angle | Left / center / right | Scroll Up, stop, or Scroll Down; blue activity LED |

Only the three DualKey audio-output actions use Raycast. Encoder volume/mute and Angle scrolling are sent directly to macOS as USB HID events.

The LEDs represent firmware-maintained state, not state read back from macOS. See [Controls](docs/controls.md) for startup behavior and limitations.

## Project Status

USB HID keyboard, consumer control, Angle auto-scroll, startup calibration, and RGB status indicators are implemented. BLE HID is planned.
